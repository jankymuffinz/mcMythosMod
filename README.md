 ## Building

To build the mod you can download the source and run `./gradlew genSources` and once your sources are generated you can build by running: `./gradlew build`.

 ## Content

<p>The mod adds a lot of spooky and folklore related stuff, including Native American folklore, Cosmic/Eldritch horror, Norse Mythology, as well as some cryptid stuff. While some stuff is heavily folklore/mythology inspired, I also wanted it to be original and fit into vanilla minecraft so much may be edited. </p>
 
<p>I plan to add JEI/REI support so that not all of the recipies will show up at the beginning, as I would like you to use the methods that I have added to discover and explore the mod, due to this reason, I also suggest not looking anything up when playing through this mod as it is designed to allow experienced and skilled players to progress very quickly, while newer players must discover things for themselves. </p>
